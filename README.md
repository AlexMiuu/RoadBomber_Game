ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
After about 2-3 months of developing this game I finally released it. You might be thinking what took me so long but I have to tell, you have no idea how many problems I've encountered with this project. Initially this was supposed to be a completely different game in terms of controls and atmosphere but I reworked everything midway through. Also I wanted to make unique graphics so I had to make my own models, which wasn't that bad after all it was an enjoyable experience. Though a lot of things happened while developing this game I had a blast overall and I am glad I finally finished it.
